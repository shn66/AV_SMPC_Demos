A collection of examples for Stochastic MPC applied to Autonomous Vehicle Scenarios



The IPython notebook allows toggling between a Traffic Intersection (TI) environment and a Highway (HW) environment, each defined in Simulators.py
SMPC.py contains various implementations of Stochastic MPC for collision avoidance between an Ego Vehicle (EV) and Target Vehicles (TVs),
using multi-modal predictions for the latter.
